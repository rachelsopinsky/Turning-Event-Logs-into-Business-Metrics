# Turning Event Logs into Business Metrics
As a junior analyst at an e-commerce company, I analyzed raw user activity logs to create a conversion funnel, cohort analysis, and retention rates. Using Google Sheets, I cleaned and transformed the data to provide insights into user behavior, helping improve website conversions and customer retention.

## **Part 1: Build a Conversion Funnel**

### Key Analysis:
- I created a **conversion funnel** to understand how well the website is converting product page views into purchases.
- The funnel consisted of three stages: product page views, adding products to the shopping cart, and completing a purchase.
- I used **pivot tables** to calculate conversion rates at each stage, as well as the overall conversion rate and conversion rate to the next step in the funnel.

**Key Visualizations**:  
- **Conversion Funnel** (user counts for each stage)  
- **Conversion Rate by Stage** (total conversion rates and step-to-step conversion rates)

## **Part 2: Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis**

### Key Analysis:
- The company wanted to understand **cohort behavior**, so I prepared the data by isolating only purchase events.
- I created a **cohort analysis** based on the month of a user’s first purchase, tracking their behavior over time.
- Key tasks included:
  - Filtering the data to include only purchase events.
  - Calculating the **first purchase date** for each user and assigning them to a cohort based on the month of their first purchase.
  - Creating new columns for **event_month**, **first_purchase_month**, and **cohort_age** to track user behavior over time.

**Key Visualizations**:  
- **Cohort Analysis** (users grouped by the month of their first purchase)  
- **Cohort Age Tracking** (users’ behavior in months 0-4)

## **Part 3: Calculate Retention Rates**

### Key Analysis:
- I aggregated the **purchase data** into cohorts and calculated the **retention rates** month by month for each cohort.
- I used **pivot tables** to count unique users in each cohort and calculated the retention rate for each cohort age (1-4 months).
- This analysis helped identify how well the company retains users over time and how cohorts performed in different months.

**Key Visualizations**:  
- **Retention Rate Table** (retention for each cohort at ages 1-4)  
- **Retention Rate by Cohort** (visualizing how retention changes over time)

## **Part 4: Organize and Document the Spreadsheet**

### Key Analysis:
- After completing the analysis, I organized the entire **spreadsheet** to ensure it was professional and easy to read.
- I filled in the **Executive Summary** sheet with results and analysis descriptions, summarizing the findings from the conversion funnel and retention analysis.
- I created a **Table of Contents** sheet to help the executive team easily navigate the data.
- The spreadsheet was formatted for readability with well-organized sheets, formatted dates and numbers, and highlighted key calculation cells.

**Key Deliverables**:  
- **Executive Summary Sheet**: Overview of findings and analysis.
- **Table of Contents**: Organized the sheet tabs for easy navigation.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Advanced Retention Analysis**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict user churn and develop more targeted retention strategies.
- **User Segmentation**: Segment users based on behavior (e.g., frequent shoppers vs. one-time buyers) and track their cohort performance.
- **Cross-Channel Analysis**: Incorporate other user data, like email campaign interaction or ad click behavior, to track conversions across channels.
